# Core Principles

## Simplicity and Pragmatism

- Write simple, pragmatic code that avoids overengineering
- Balance simplicity with readability - avoid overly terse code at the expense of clarity

## Future-Proof Architecture

- Design clear abstractions and APIs that enable replacing system components
- Consider extensibility without premature optimization

## Self-Documenting Code

- Use descriptive variable names, function names, and class names
- Write code that clearly expresses its intent through naming and structure
- Minimize comments by making the code itself readable
